# Jan2.2021.OneKattisADayChallenge
This is my 2021 new year's resolution to do one kattis problem a day.
Let's see how many problems I can do it in one year, and see what happens.
To be honest, I'm not into programming lately, and I have not done much study in a while, but we all need some decipline right?
